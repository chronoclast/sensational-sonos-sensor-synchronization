# Sensational Sonos Sensor Synchronization

## Introduction

##### ------------ WORK IN PROGRESS ------------

Wouldn't it be nice to come home and have your music on automatically? And what if you could control the speaker easily, just using your voice?

Well, it's still a work in progress!  
But meanwhile you can see this video (*recorded after some Spanish wines*), in which we explain briefly how it works:

This project is mainly divided in two parts: The first one consists on running a local API on a Linux-based single-board computer, and fire HTTP requests from different sensors

## Requirements

##### ------------ WORK IN PROGRESS ------------

**For the first part of this project**, i.e. to trigger actions in your Sonos speaker using data from sensors you will need:

* [Sonos](http://www.sonos.com) speaker (see note below)
* A WiFi development kit
* Magnetic switch
* Grove PIR sensor
* Orange Pi set, consisting on:
	* [Orange Pi One] (http://www.orangepi.org/orangepione) single-board computer
	* 4GB SD Card (8GB is strongly recommended)
	* A decent 5V/2A USB power supply (like [this one](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00JWXT6BK/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_TIjTyb0T3E30H))
	* A USB to 4.0x1.7mm DC jack cable (like [this one](http://tinkersphere.com/power/1746-orange-pi-power-cable-usb.html))

**As for the second part**, you will need:

* An [Amazon Echo](http://a.co/9imYj0b) (or an [Echo Dot](http://a.co/4MYRdzt))

**NOTE:** This project will work great with any Sonos PLAY:1, PLAY:3 or PLAY:5. It has not been tested in other devices, but it will likely work well. As for the single-board computer, the first version of this project has been deployed in an Orange Pi One, but it may work in other Armbian-based boards. More boards will be added soon, including the Raspberry Pi.
