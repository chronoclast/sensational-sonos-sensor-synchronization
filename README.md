# Sensational Sonos Sensor Synchronization

## Introduction

Wouldn't it be nice to come home and have your music on automatically? And what if you could control the speaker easily, just using your voice?

Well, it's still a work in progress!  
But meanwhile you can see this video (*recorded after some Spanish wines*), in which we explain briefly how it works:

This project is mainly divided in two parts:

* **The first one** consists on running a local API on a Linux-based single-board computer, and fire HTTP requests to the Sonos local API depending on the readings comming from different sensors. The speaker can then play music (or shuffle songs, or change the volume, etc.) based on these events.

* **The second** makes it possible to control the speaker using voice commands from an Amazon Echo device.

## Requirements

### First Part

To trigger actions in your Sonos speaker using data from sensors you will need:

* [Sonos](http://www.sonos.com) speaker (see note below).
* A WiFi development kit (see note below).
* Magnetic switch (optional).
* Grove PIR sensor.
* Orange Pi set, consisting on:
	* [Orange Pi One] (http://www.orangepi.org/orangepione) single-board computer
	* 4GB SD Card (8GB is strongly recommended)
	* A decent 5V/2A USB power supply (like [this one](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00JWXT6BK/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_TIjTyb0T3E30H))
	* A USB to 4.0x1.7mm DC jack cable (like [this one](http://tinkersphere.com/power/1746-orange-pi-power-cable-usb.html))

A [developer account on the relayr Cloud (free)](https://dev.relayr.io) is required to onboard the WiFi sensor nodes.

### Second Part

To control the Sonos speaker using your voice, you will need:

* An [Amazon Echo](http://a.co/9imYj0b) (or an [Echo Dot](http://a.co/4MYRdzt))

To create and deploy the Alexa skill, a [developer account on Amazon (free)](https://developer.amazon.com) and an [account in AWS (free but requires confirmation via credit card)](https://aws.amazon.com) are needed.

### Notes About the Requirements

This project will work great with any Sonos PLAY:1, PLAY:3 or PLAY:5. It has not been tested in other Sonos devices, but it will likely work well.

As for the single-board computer, the first version of this project has been deployed in an Orange Pi One, but it may work in other Armbian-based boards. More boards will be added soon, including the Raspberry Pi.

Regarding the WiFi development kit, almost any ESP8266-based board will do. In the first version of this project, a [WeMos D1 mini](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/D1-mini-Mini-NodeMcu-4M-bytes-Lua-WIFI-Internet-of-Things-development-board-based-ESP8266/1331105_32529101036.html?spm=2114.12010108.0.0.yP8NGa) has been used due to its low price tag. The codes for the [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit) will be added in the future as well.

## Installation & Configuration

##### ------------ WORK IN PROGRESS ------------

## To Do

* Create the project structure.
* OPTIONAL: Create the solution architecture.
